# Fill Hole Plugin

**Fill Hole** is a Minecraft plugin designed to efficiently fill holes in a selected region.  
It integrates with **WorldEdit** and leverages the **FAWE API** for optimal performance.

## Main Command

### `/fillhole <pattern>`
This command detects and fills holes in the selected region with the specified pattern.  
- **Usage**: Select a region using WorldEdit, then execute the command with a pattern (e.g., `stone`, `dirt`, or combinations like `stone,dirt`).  
- **Undoable**: Changes made by the command can be reverted using WorldEdit's **undo** command.  
- **Task-Based Execution**: Uses Bukkit tasks to handle large regions without crashing.  
- **Progress Bar**: Displays completion status while filling holes.  

You can also use the alias `/fh`.

## New Masks

### `#translucent`
Filters out translucent blocks when selecting terrain.

### `#full_cube`
Filters blocks to include only full cubes, useful for terrain cleanup.

These masks are useful when starting **Terraforming** or fixing broken terrain.
